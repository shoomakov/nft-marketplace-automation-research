# User story

As a user of the NFT marketplace, I want to be able to connect my wallet to the platform so that I can buy, sell, and trade NFTs seamlessly.

When I arrive on the NFT marketplace website, I see a prompt to connect my wallet. I click on the prompt, and a pop-up appears asking me to download the Chrome extension. I download and install the extension, which automatically connects to my wallet.

Once my wallet is connected, I can view my balance and browse the available NFTs for sale. When I find an NFT that I want to purchase, I can simply click on the "Buy" button, and the transaction will be completed automatically through my connected wallet.

If I want to sell an NFT, I can easily list it for sale and receive payments directly to my connected wallet. And if I want to trade NFTs with other users, the platform will handle the transaction in a secure and transparent way, with all transactions recorded on the blockchain.

In summary, by connecting my wallet to the NFT marketplace through the Chrome extension, I can easily buy, sell, and trade NFTs without having to worry about managing multiple wallets or transferring funds manually.
